# FIFA

Just made a fun project that uses pandas to get the best possible 11 of players in the last 5 FIFAs based on overall rating.  
Inspiration for this project was actually a tweet that I came across which can be found [here](https://github.com/farhankapadia/FIFA/blob/master/pics/tweet.jpg).  
I took the tweet up as a challenge and was able to generate a team of players.  
However, it still needs a bit of refinement as the four defenders shown can all be CBs sometimes instead of having a full back.    
I plan on updating that section whenever I can.    
A sample output can be found [here](https://github.com/farhankapadia/FIFA/blob/master/pics/output.PNG)  

PS: Again, I was only just introduced to pandas when I made this so please excuse the tedious iterative approaches adopted :P
